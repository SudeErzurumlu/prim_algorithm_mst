# Prim's Algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

## Description
This project implements Prim's Algorithm to find the Minimum Spanning Tree of a connected, weighted graph. The algorithm grows the MST by selecting the smallest edge connecting a vertex in the MST to a vertex outside it.

## Features
- Efficiently finds the minimum spanning tree.
- Applicable for graph optimization and network design.

## Usage
1. Input a graph with weights.
2. The algorithm outputs the MST for the given graph.
